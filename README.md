# New Music USA Coding Challenge: Exercise 2

I built a simple SPA using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This is a mock-up a personal website for a composer (I've added in images and details of a composer I collaborate with).

I recreated jQuery methods like AJAX calls, fadeIn/fadeOut transitions, and CSS toggles with plain JavaScript.

### Further extensions:
I'd like to flesh out a light CMS that posts to a Rails (or PHP, as I expand my skillset there) server. Working without any JavaScript libraries or frameworks helps me keep my code neat, and from a design sense, makes it easy to avoid feature creep or unnecessary bells and whistles -- everything I add is there intentionally.
I look forward to continuing this project and developing my JavaScript skills!
